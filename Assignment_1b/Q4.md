The provided program employs several key concepts and algorithms from Graph Theory to solve the minimum cash flow problem among multiple banks. Here's an expanded explanation of these concepts and the algorithm used:

### Key Concepts and Algorithms

1. **Graph Representation**:
    - **Adjacency Matrix**: The program uses a 2D array (adjacency matrix) to represent the transactions between banks. Each element `graph[i][j]` represents the amount bank `i` owes to bank `j`. This matrix helps in visualizing and managing the flow of transactions.

2. **Net Amount Calculation**:
    - The net amount for each bank is calculated by summing up all the incoming and outgoing transactions. This is done using two loops:
        - One loop iterates over columns to calculate the incoming amounts (credits).
        - Another loop iterates over rows to calculate the outgoing amounts (debits).
    - The net amount is stored in a `listOfNetAmounts` array, where each element represents the net amount a bank owes or is owed.

3. **Greedy Algorithm**:
    - **Minimizing Cash Flow**:
        - The algorithm identifies the bank with the maximum positive net amount (the one to whom the most money is owed) and the bank with the maximum negative net amount (the one that owes the most money).
        - It performs transactions between these two banks to reduce their net amounts to zero, thereby minimizing the number of transactions required to settle all debts.
        - This process is repeated until all net amounts are zero, meaning all debts are settled.
    - **Max Intersection of Payment Types**:
        - The algorithm ensures that transactions are prioritized where the involved banks have common payment types. This minimizes the use of the intermediary (World Bank) and leverages common payment methods for efficiency.

4. **Set Intersection**:
    - The program uses set operations to find common payment types between banks. By intersecting the sets of payment types for each pair of banks, it identifies feasible transactions that can be conducted without the need for the intermediary.

5. **Optimization and Complexity Consideration**:
    - The algorithm carefully considers the complexity of operations such as set intersection and aims to balance multiple criteria, including net amounts and available payment types, to optimize the transaction process.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Input and Initialization**:
    - The program starts by taking input for the number of banks, their names, and their available payment types.
    - It also takes input for the number of transactions and the details of each transaction.

2. **Net Amount Calculation**:
    - For each bank, the program calculates the net amount by summing up all incoming and outgoing transactions.

3. **Transaction Minimization**:
    - Using a greedy approach, the program identifies the banks with the maximum positive and negative net amounts.
    - It performs transactions between these banks to minimize their net amounts.
    - The process repeats until all net amounts are zero.

4. **Result Printing**:
    - Finally, the program prints the transactions required to minimize cash flow, indicating which bank pays which amount to which other bank and via which payment method.

### Example Execution

Here's an example to illustrate the process:

#### Input
- Number of banks: 5
- Bank details:
  - A: t1, t2
  - B: t1
  - C: t1
  - D: t2
  - E: t2
- Number of transactions: 4
  - B pays A: 300
  - C pays A: 700
  - D pays B: 500
  - E pays B: 500

#### Output
- Transactions for minimizing cash flow:
  - D pays Rs 500 to B via t2
  - E pays Rs 500 to B via t2
  - B pays Rs 300 to A via t1
  - C pays Rs 700 to A via t1

In summary, the program effectively uses graph theory, set operations, and a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of transactions required to settle debts among multiple banks, ensuring efficient and feasible transactions based on available payment methods.
